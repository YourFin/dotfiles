LanguageTool - language checker.
An Open Source language checker for English, French, German, Polish, Dutch, Romanian, Russian and other languages. This is a rule-based language checker that will find errors for which a rule is defined in its XML configuration files. Rules for more complicated errors can be written in Java. You can think of LanguageTool as a tool to detect errors that a simple spell checker cannot detect, e.g. mixing up there/their, no/now etc. It can also detect some grammar mistakes. It does not include spell checking for OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice version.
LanguageTool will only find errors for which a rule is defined in its XML configuration files. Rules for more complicated errors can be written in Java.
Requires Java 7. We strongly recommend using LibreOffice 3.5.4 or Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1 or later as older versions have a bug that causes a freeze on startup. You need to restart OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice after installation of this extension.
You can select required grammar rules in Tools -> LanguageTool -> Configuration menu.
If you are using LibreOffice 3.5.x or later and you want to check English texts: Use Options -> Language Settings -> Writing Aids -> Edit... to disable LightProof and enable LanguageTool for English
