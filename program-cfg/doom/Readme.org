* What is this?
My private configuration for [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom emacs]]. It's pretty cool. Fast loading emacs
for vim people, with auto complete, tabs, etc. Requires emacs >= 26.

** Random things to install:
- A c build toolchain with cmake
- ripgrep
- Make sure emacs has [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/tree/develop/modules/term/vterm][been compiled with dynamic module support]]. Vterm makes
  emacs terminals not crap, and this is important.

* How do I read this?
The code here has three entry points from doom proper: [[./init.el][init.el]], [[./packages.el][packages.el]], and
[[config.el][config.el]]. Init is loaded pretty early, config pretty late. Packages is for
packages.

The rest of the files in this directory are attempts at organizing config.el,
and are loaded by it.
